# Matrix
The source code of the matrix, the program which runs the universe

## How it was obtained
Disclaimer: this isn't the original source (that was written in ancient Hebrew), but a Google-translated version.
The Hebrew source code was found on gold tablets on a mountain near Manchester, Egypt.

## How to download and run
Unfortunately, I don't have a copy of the build tools at the present date, but, if you manage to find/create one, let me know!

###### Disclaimer: For those of you who haven't realized yet, yes, this is a joke.
